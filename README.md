# A Breath of Fresh Air
## Team: No Man’s Smog
### Pitch
Be the hero your city needs. Save the city’s coughing citizens from clouds of smog
in this breathtaking action game. Quickly move around the streets to evaporate
toxic fumes and make sure to catch your breath before the next wave of pollution
threatens your city. Save the citizens one breath of fresh air at a time.
### Core Gameplay
The player moves around streets of a city with the purpose to protect NPCs
from clouds of smog. The smog clouds appear in random places and move
around the streets. NPCs are affected by being exposed to smog and will die
over a given periode of time. To avoid this, the player must evaporate them by
reaching the polluted place in time. Over time new skills are aqcuired to deal
with the steady increase in pollution. The game runs either for a specific time-
span or runs until all citizens have died. When the decided end state has been
reached, the player is scored on her/his efforts.
